        \emph{All For One} is system composed by a mobile application and a cloud server communicating through WbeSockets and a REST API.

        This system wants to make easy the collaboration between its patients and keepers with features such as real-time chats, geolocation and task management. This way we plan to reduce as much as possible the difficulties thrown by this pathology.
